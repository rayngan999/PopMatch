# Testing Plan
Our testing plan would be to ask friends, family, roommates and/or classmates, to ask them the following questions(survey data):
1. Is the sign up and log in smooth? (from 1-5, 1 being very laggy, 5 being very smooth)
2. How's the layout of each view controller? (from 1-5, 1 being very complex and hard to understand, 5 being very simple and easy to understand)
3. Does the navigation between each view controller make sense? (from 1-5, 1 being messy, 5 being very straightforward)
4. How is the number of the sign up questions? (1-5, 1 being too little, 5 being too much)
5. How is the quality of the sign up questions? (1-5, 1 being poor, 5 being great)
6. Is the usage of a password working? The verification? (YES/NO)
7. How good is the matching? Is it working correctly? How often do you match with someone with similar categories? (1-5, 1 being not often, 5 being very often)
8. How is the quality of the video aspect? (1-5, 1 being laggy, 5 being very smooth)

We will average out this data and update accordingly. We would also ask them to put purposely put in bad information to test our error checking, to tap on screen to check the tap gestures and to go back and forth between view controllers to see that everything is clean, without any unnecessary default messages. Also to check deletion of accounts, creation of two accounts with the same email and etc.
